## Description
Hungry Alvaro is a dynamic and entertaining game developed in Python using the Pygame library. Step into the world of Alvaro and create delicious pizzas according to his orders! The game features three exciting modes, each with unique challenges that test your speed and accuracy.

## Game Modes
- **Hungry Alvaro**: Complete as many orders as possible within a set time limit. Earn points for each pizza based on accuracy
- **Moody Alvaro**: Fulfill orders against the clock. There's an upper limit on the number of pizzas you can make, with points awarded for accuracy.
- **Alvaro with the Boys**: Handle multiple orders simultaneously with a specific time limit. Failure to complete an order deducts points, while successful completion earns points as in the other modes.
